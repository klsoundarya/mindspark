### Wireframes

I have used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to design my website wireframes for mobile, laptop and desktop screen sizes to see and work on my website designing.

### Mobile Wireframes
<!-- learnt the dropdown from https://dev.to/asyraf/how-to-add-dropdown-in-markdown-o78 -->
<!-- My website has evolved from the initial wireframes I created earlier in the project. While the design now looks bit different from the original plan, I see this as a natural progression as the project developed. The changes reflect new ideas and insights that came up during the development process, resulting in a structure that aligns better with the projectâ€™s goals. -->

## Deployment

<details>
<summary>To create the project from scratch, fork or clone use the following steps...</summary>
<br>

To begin this project from scratch, you must first create a new GitHub repository using the [Code Institute's Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). This template provides the relevant tools to get you started. To use this template:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or create a new account.
2. Navigate to the above CI Full Template.
3. Click '**Use this template**' -> '**Create a new repository**'.
4. Choose a new repository name and click '**Create repository from template**'.
5. In your new repository space, (choice of your IDE) click the button to generate a new workspace.

## Django Project Setup

1. Install Django and supporting libraries: 
   
- ```pip3 install 'django<4.2.16' gunicorn```
- ```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```
- ```pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage```  
  
2. Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a **requirements.txt** file and add all installed libraries to it with the ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` command in the terminal.  
3. Create a new Django project in the terminal ```django-admin startproject mindspark .```
4. Create a new app example: ```python3 mangage.py startapp shop```
5. Add this to list of **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** - 'shop',
6. Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
7. Migrate the changes with commands: ```python3 manage.py migrate```
8. An **env.py** file must be created to store all protected data such as the **DATABASE_URL**, **cloudinary** and **SECRET_KEY**. These may be called upon in your project's **settings.py** file along with your Database configurations. The **env.py** file must be added to your **gitignore** file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. For adding to **env.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURLfromPostgreSQL>"```
- ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"```
  
For adding to **settings.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```import dj_database_url```
- ```if os.path.exists("env.py"):```
- ```import env```
- ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')``` (actual key hidden within env.py)  

9. Replace **DATABASES** with:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

10. Set up the templates directory in **settings.py**:
- Under ``BASE_DIR`` enter ``TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, â€˜templatesâ€™)``
- Update ``TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`` with:

```
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')
```

- Create the media, static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.

11. A **Procfile** must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: ```web: gunicorn mindspark.wsgi```
12. Make the necessary migrations again.

## Cloudinary API 

Cloudinary provides a cloud hosting solution for media storage. All users uploaded images in the mindspark project are hosted here.

Set up a new account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your **env.py** and Heroku Config Vars.
In your project workspace: 

- Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 
- In the order: 
```
   'cloudinary_storage',  
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
   'cloudinary',
```
- Add to **env.py** and link up with **settings.py**: ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://...."``` 
- Set Cloudinary as storage for media and static files in settings.py:
- ```STATIC_URL = '/static/'```
```
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'  
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]  
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')â€Œ  
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

## Deployment Process for PostgreSQL

To deploy **Mindspark** with PostgreSQL as the database, follow these steps:

A new database instance can be created from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your project. 

#### 1. Configure PostgreSQL
   - Open the PostgreSQL command-line tool:
     ```bash
     sudo -u postgres psql
     ```
   - Create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE mindspark_db;
     ```
   - Create a new user with a password:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER shop_admin WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
     ```
   - Grant the user access to the database:
     ```sql
     ALTER ROLE shop_admin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
     ALTER ROLE shop_admin SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
     ALTER ROLE shop_admin SET timezone TO 'UTC';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mindspark_db TO shop_admin;
     ```
   - Exit the PostgreSQL prompt:
     ```sql
     \q
     ```

#### 2. Update Django Settings
   - In your Django project, go to `settings.py` and update the `DATABASES` setting:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
             'NAME': 'mindspark_db',
             'USER': 'mindspark_admin',
             'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
             'HOST': 'localhost',  # or IP address if using a remote server
             'PORT': '5432',       # default PostgreSQL port
         }
     }
     ```

#### 3. Apply Migrations
   - Run migrations to create the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

#### 4. Verify the Setup
   - Start your Django server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Visit your site to verify that the database is working as expected.

- From your user dashboard, retrieve the important 'postgres://....' value. Place the value within your **DATABASE_URL**  in your **env.py** file and follow the below instructions to place it in your Heroku Config Vars.

## Heroku Deployment

To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account if you are a new user.
2. Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the '**New**' button in the top, right corner, and select '**Create New App**'.
3. Enter an app name and choose your region. Click '**Create App**'.
4. In the Deploy tab, click on the '**Settings**', reach the '**Config Vars**' section and click on '**Reveal Config Vars**'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your:

   - **DATABASE_URL**:**postgres://...**
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),
   - **SECRET_KEY** and value  
   - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY** and value
   - **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** and value
   - **EMAIL_HOST_PASS** and value
   - **EMAIL_HOST_USER** and value
   - **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY** and value
   - **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** and value
   - **STRIPE_WH_SECRET** and value
   - **USE_AWS** and value

5. Add the Heroku host name into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in your projects **settings.py file** -> ```['herokuappname', â€˜localhostâ€™, â€˜8000 port urlâ€™].```
2. Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that **DEBUG=False**, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.
3. Go to the '**Deploy**' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.
4. Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the '**Connect**' button.
5. Choose from '**Automatic**' or '**Manual**' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click '**Deploy Branch**'.
6.  Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the '**View**' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC**  may be removed from the Config Vars once you have saved and pushed an image within your project.

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.

You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [mindspark repository](https://github.com/klsoundarya/mindspark)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [mindspark repository](https://github.com/klsoundarya/mindspark)
2. Find the Code button situated above the file list and give it a click.
3. Choose your preferred cloning method â€” whether it's HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub and hit the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Launch Git Bash or Terminal.
5. Navigate to the directory where you want the cloned directory to reside.
6. In your IDE Terminal, input the following command to clone the repository:

**AllAuth**  

Django AllAuth is a versatile framework designed to handle user registration, login, email verification, password forgot and authentication seamlessly. It ensures secure access control by managing registered and unregistered users, determining what content is accessible on the "Mindspark" website.

The setup process for AllAuth included the following steps:

- Installing the package as a project dependency.
- Adding it to the INSTALLED_APPS section in settings.py.
- Configuring the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS as recommended in the AllAuth documentation.
- Including AllAuth URLs in the project's urls.py file for routing.
- Running database migrations to create the required authentication-related tables.

**CSRF Tokens** 

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are security features included in every form on the site. These tokens help ensure that form submissions are authenticated and come from legitimate users. Without CSRF tokens, the website could be vulnerable to malicious attacks where unauthorized users might attempt to steal sensitive user data or perform actions without permission.

- When links are broken users can see the custom error code for 400, 403, 404, 500 pages.

There are media query breakpoints. This convenient feature allows users to easily access different sections of the website, making the browsing experience smoother and more efficient.

- Changed the icon of the contact, so it varies in the features image.

### Project Planning 

<details>
<summary>Stages of Planning</summary>
<br>

## Strategy Plane

The "Mindspark" website is an innovative e-commerce platform dedicated to providing thoughtfully curated products that enhance hands-on learning, productivity, and lifestyle. The project began with a focus on Montessori learning tools, aiming to support young minds with interactive, educational resources.

## Agile Methodologies

The development of the "Mindspark" website followed Agile methodologies, focusing on iterative progress and continuous feedback. I used my [Github Projects Board](https://github.com/users/klsoundarya/projects/5) to plan and document all of my work.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

For the development of **Mindspark**, I applied the **MoSCoW Prioritization Method** to efficiently manage features and ensure that key elements were delivered on time:

**Must Haves:** These are the essential features needed to launch the MVP. They include:

- User registration and authentication system.
- Home page with Latest Blog Highlights, about us with Shop Now button.
- A product catalog with shopping cart functionality.
- The ability for users to add products to their cart and checkout.
- An e-commerce page showcasing the products, sorting features, related products.
- Integration with payment systems like Stripe.

**Should Haves:** These features are important but not essential for the initial release:

- Product reviews and ratings.
- Product search and filter functionality.
- User profile management and order history.

**Could Haves:** Features that add extra value but are not necessary for the MVP:

- Email notifications for order confirmation and shipping updates.
- User wishlist functionality.
- Interactive educational content related to Montessori tools.

**Wonâ€™t Haves:** Features excluded or deprioritized for this release:

- Multi-language support.
- Advanced recommendation system.

This prioritization helped keep the project focused on key features while leaving room for future enhancements.
